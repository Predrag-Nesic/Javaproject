# Javaproject
This is the final project that i was required to finnish in order to get the sertificate.
The realization of the whole project is of my doing, except the Database.java file in base folder, and Model.java in models folder.
I got that from my teacher, so that I could connect to the xampp server and to manipulate with the objects of other classes trough methods that are necessary.
In the near future I'll do my best to finish it. I only have to limit the reservation to only 48 hours, and to enable the users to be blocked if they do not buy the tickets that they reserved.
Feel free to add anything that will be of any use to this project in order to make it better. I am open to suggestions.
I hope that you like it, i really did my best... For now :)...
